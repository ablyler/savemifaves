# FAQ
## For Restaurant-goers
### What is Save MI Faves?
Save MI Faves is a directory of Ann Arbor restaurants and coffee shops that offer online gift cards for purchase. It’s our hope that by providing this resource, we’ll be able to mobilize loyal customers to provide much-needed support for their favorite places in town.

### Why isn’t my favorite business on your site?
Please help us add your fave Michigan food & beverage spots [here](/submit/). We're open to adding more small business categories if this catches on.

### How else can I support our local businesses beyond purchasing a gift card?

*	Delivery and pickup are great options! Some restaurants that don’t normally offer delivery have started to offer curbside pickup during the pandemic, so check their websites and social media to see what’s available.
    *	Tip generously if you can (even for delivery/pickup), since employees are doing extra work and putting their health at risk.
*	Consider purchasing one or more “Flatten the Curve” T-shirts from Underground Printing’s [Hospitality Fundraiser](https://pogo.undergroundshirts.com/collections/ann-arbor-hospitality-fundraiser?aff=22), with proceeds going to support Ann Arbor restaurants.
*	Encourage the government to get involved. Sign this [Michigan petition](https://www.change.org/p/michigan-state-house-compensate-michigan-small-business-owners?original_footer_petition_id=20311463&algorithm=promoted&source_location=petition_footer&grid_position=11&pt=AVBldGl0aW9uABulPgEAAAAAXm%2FKuNQejk01MTI0YmMyMA%3D%3D) to encourage state lawmakers to compensate small businesses affected by the shutdown of restaurants and bars. You can also call your US Representative and your Senators via the Capitol switchboard (202-224-3121) to demand that small businesses are part of the federal stimulus plan.

### Why is this just for the Ann Arbor area? Can you do this for my city?
As Ann Arbor residents, we started this project for our community. We hope to expand to other areas in Michigan in the future. To help grow our directory, please add information about your favorite Michigan food & drink businesses that sell gift cards online [here](/submit/).

If you are outside Michigan and would like to build a similar site for your community, our source code is available via GitHub. You can find it [here](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}).

People have also launched similar tools for their specific cities, or even nationally. Check out [Help Main Street](https://helpmainstreet.com/), [GiveLocal](https://givelocal.co/), and [Rally for Restaurants](https://rallyforrestaurants.com/).

### Who built this? And why?
We’re a small team of entrepreneurs from Ann Arbor, led by Josh Botkin (of the [University of Michigan](http://zli.umich.edu/) and [HistoSonics](https://ww2.frost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HistoSonics-Award-Write-Up.pdf)) and Steve Schwartz (of [Alfa Jango](https://www.alfajango.com/) and [Genomenon](https://www.genomenon.com/)). Our terrific logo was designed by Steve’s colleague Kevin Ryan (of [Alfa Jango](https://www.alfajango.com/)).

But mostly, we’re loyal customers who are concerned about what these local businesses are going through and want to do whatever we can to help keep them afloat. We’re no longer going out because of COVID-19, so we started buying gift cards to help support our favorite cafes and restaurants during this unpredictable time – and we want to enable others to do so as well.

We were inspired by a similar Bay Area project ([www.SaveOurFaves.org](https://www.saveourfaves.org)) launched by Kaitlyn & Mike Krieger -- a husband and wife duo in San Francisco. Mike and Kaitlyn generously agreed to let us repurpose some of the content from their site (including much of this FAQ), and they have also posted their site’s source code to GitHub so that others can make use of it. Thank you, Kaitlyn and Mike!

## For Businesses
### Why isn’t my business listed on your site?
If you operate a Michigan-based food & drink business that sells gift cards online, please add your company’s info [here](/submit/). We hope to expand beyond food & drink businesses, so if you operate a different type of business please check back soon.

### How can I start offering online gift cards?
The first step is to check with your Point-of-Sale (POS) technology provider. Many vendors (e.g. Square, Toast, ShopKeep) offer their own gift card features, and others integrate with specific third-party providers. If your POS provider doesn’t offer gift cards or integrate with third-party providers, there are some reasonable standalone eGift Card apps like GiftUp or GiftFly. If you’re considering other options, make sure that your business receives the fee for the gift card as soon as the customer purchases the card (otherwise that won’t help you during the crisis). Some services may also ask customers to pay an additional fee when they buy a gift card but be sure it’s a small amount.

### How can I encourage customers to buy gift cards?
People are looking for ways they can support their favorite businesses, so don’t be afraid to let them know that gift cards will help. Reach out to your community on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and use your email list to get in touch with your customers. Ask them to consider buying a gift card for one month of spending to help you weather this storm and keep paying staff, so that you can continue offering great food/coffee/etc. for years to come.
